# What is this Project?

This project is a React calculator that uses the `useReducer` hook for managing state, supporting basic arithmetic operations. It features a clear UI that shows both current and previous calculations, aiding user comprehension. The application relies on a reducer function for handling actions such as digit input, operation selection, and calculations, ensuring maintainable code. It employs modular components for buttons, enhancing reusability, and is styled with CSS for a modern appearance. This calculator demonstrates effective React practices for interactive and visually appealing web applications.
